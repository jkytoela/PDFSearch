The project is essentially a POC and really incomplete. The main purpose is to learn more about docker-compose, MinIO and ElasticSearch.

You can upload PDF files to the application. Their basic information is stored in a database and their text content is indexed. Once uploaded, the files can be searched by their text content.

Technologies used:
- Docker
- TypeScript
- Express.js
- React
- MinIO (S3 compatible object storage)
- Apache Tika
- ElasticSearch
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- nginx

TODO:
- The front-end search functionality
- TBD...
